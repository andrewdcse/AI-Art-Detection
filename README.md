# Using Neural Networks to Detect AI Art

While AI has been used to generate images since its inception, the use of deep learning to generate images resembling art has only recently been brought to the public forefront. Following the public releases of diffusion-based image generation models in mid-2022 such as DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, various moral and ethical concerns have been raised regarding their outputs and methods<sup>[1]</sup>.

One concern is that it will be increasingly difficult to tell human-created art from images generated by models. While humans are often better at classifying objects compared to neural networks, a neural network might be useful in detecting the lower-level nuances that distinguish human art from model-generated images. **In this project, we demonstrate that neural networks can detect whether an image is AI-generated, and that transfer learning is surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) powerful for performing this task accurately.**
